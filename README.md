# Posty

A simple static site generator tool. Reads in a series of posts and pages
containing YAML metadata and Markdown text, and renders them as HTML.

This is what powers [my personal website](https://nickpegg.com).

This was mostly written for fun. There are other, probably better and
definitely more full-featured static site generators out there.

## Development
Bootstrap your environment with the `make develop` command. It's highly
recommended to use a virtualenv or something when doing this.
